# Image-Classification
This web-based application lets users upload an image and receive a predicted classification using a pre-trained deep learning model. Built with Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend, it uses TensorFlow and Keras to run the MobileNetV2 model for image classification.
